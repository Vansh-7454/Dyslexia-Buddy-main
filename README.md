# **Dyslexi-AI: Early Detection and Therapy with Multi Feature**

## **Overview**

**Dyslexi-AI** is a gamified platform designed to assist in the early detection and therapy for dyslexia. The platform leverages educational games to track a user's progress, adjust difficulty levels dynamically using Q-learning, and provide personalized feedback. It includes various interactive games aimed at improving the skills of dyslexic students, such as the **Phonics Game**, **Rhyme Race**,  and others, while focusing on learning and cognitive development.

The platform also includes a comprehensive system for tracking user performance, awarding badges, providing a leaderboard, and offering personal dashboards with graphs that show overall improvement across games.

## **Key Features**

- **Q-learning-powered Difficulty Adjustment**: Dynamic difficulty adaptation based on user performance.
- **Multilingual Support**: The platform supports multiple languages (English, Kannada, Hindi) to cater to a diverse user base.
- **Gamification**: Includes badges, points, daily streaks, and weekly challenges to motivate users.
- **User Performance Tracking**: Detailed user dashboards displaying progress, performance, and earned badges.
- **Leaderboard**: Display users' points, accuracy, and rankings across games.
- **Interactive Educational Games**: Games like Phonics, Rhyme Race, and Sequence Sorter are designed to help with dyslexia therapy.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing user stats, points, accuracy, and badges)
- **Game Logic**: Q-learning algorithm for dynamic difficulty adjustment
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication
